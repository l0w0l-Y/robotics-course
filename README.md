# Robotics course :superhero_woman:
Contains all homework for the course of robotics. 
To complete tasks, the :snake: `python` programming language and the libraries of `opencv-python` and `numpy` are used.
All tasks are divided into folders.
## Exercise 1

One practical application of warping in OpenCV can be to warp an image into a smaller one with a mouse clicking. Need to implement image deformation on mouse click.
## Exercise 3

 Record a video from a webcam to a mp4-file with OpenCV
